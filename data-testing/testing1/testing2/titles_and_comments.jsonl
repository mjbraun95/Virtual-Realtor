House prices are determined by their monthly mortgage. So the price of that 500k house has to drop significantly. Your mortgage payments are up over a thousand a month from if you bought that same house last year. \n\nThese current prices are just copium, right now. Anyone who bought in 2021 and 2022 are very soon going to be under water.", "Hello everyone,\n\nOctober proved to be an interesting month and the market is showing a fair bit of resilience despite the doom and gloom surrounding inflation and interest rates.\n\nThis month I decided to visualize every sale for the month based on sold price and size. That is what is giving you the scatter plot at the bottom of the graphic. It is interesting the number of properties sold over 1M is higher than you would have expected. Also, some of those properties are not that large even.\n\nThe active inventory is still at levels similar to last year even though the absorption rate seems to be creeping up with online Sherwood Park having under 3 months of inventory. This is still significantly below recent historical numbers prior to the pandemic where inventories were over 7/8 thousand units. The over-list sales are also dropping with the University and North West areas not seeing a single property sell for an over-list price. The reasons could be higher than average list prices and less\n\nWhile activity has been lower than in 2020 and 2021. It is still above the pre-pandemic levels. The most intriguing element is the sold property makeup. The number of homes sold only made up 59% of the units sold in 2022. The increasing number of duplex sales and steady condo and townhouse numbers also push the number lower.\n\nThe main complaint currently seems to be the disconnect between buyers and sellers on perceived value. Sellers are still thinking summer prices are correct while buyers are hesitant to pay pre-pandemic prices let alone the seemingly inflated values of earlier in the year. Affordability is at levels not seen since 2007, I do not think prices will drop much but there will be much less competition for homes which makes the market much fairer for buyers who have been operating under conditions that were less than ideal with deals that were unconditional and with blind bidding.\n\nNovember is seeing the seasonal inventory drop off and fewer listings.

A great way to predict the upcoming condo market is to evaluate the months of supply. As supply goes down, demand goes up and prices can have a healthy boost.

This largely has to do with the constant construction of new condo products, oversupplying the market where the demand simply isn't there---yet. Condo fees have a huge impact on your sale value as well. Remember that when folks are getting pre-qualified for mortgages, brokers will factor in approx costs of condo fees as well.

The EREB is notorious for misreporting or changing the sales figures after the fact the reason is simply the reporting of home sales by realtors. That is why those news stories are tough to fact check later. What I have is the MLS data directly from the EREB and hopefully it is complete.\n\nYou say peak price in May 2007 was 424572 when it was actually 451171 for that date for market as a whole.  A value that was surpassed a few times (Not many albeit since). The big thing is only 912 people in Edmonton purchased homes at the peak while price was dramatically lower before and after. Timing the market is impossible but the same can be said for stock investments as well. Over time and held long enough the argument that is always goes up should be considered moderately true but then you can say go look at detroit. The inflation we talk about will drive prices higher but again that does not mean buying a home or property is a good investment. At best it can be viewed as a superior living arrangement choice sometimes. \n\nAs for Condos The Peak price for the entire Metro market was 279,712 (275k for Edmonton and 305K for Area) and that was in July 2007 (In mine I include a few more so maybe there is some discrepancy there). Median Price was 269,900 for that month as well. As you can see they did not recover. \n\nI have aggregated the outlying areas to make for more consistent data. \n\nWe are also ignoring the benefits of owning a home as well.  What benefit does owning shares of apple provide? Meanwhile, a home you can live in or rent out or both. \n\n\n\nBuyers remorse is a real thing as is the fear of missing out.

The impact of 0 down 40 year mortgages in 2007 was significant no doubt. \n\nI just don't think \"investment\" should be a major influence of someone's decision to purchase the home they live in, unless they are speculating on the neighborhood or land utilization. The most important factors of purchasing property as a principal residence (in my view) is buying into a lifestyle, neighborhood, amenities. I was hoping that those points might put someone like OP at ease that the decision to buy shouldn't be based on whether real estate is up or down 2% this year, because it's sometimes wrong to think of it as only an investing decision.

If mortgages are more expensive, the cost of a house is more expensive. Unless people are earning more money, they can't afford higher housing prices. If sellers want to sell their house, and purchasers can't afford the higher prices, the sellers need yo lower their price. As sellers lower their prices, the average cost of a house declines.\r\rThe problem Edmonton may have is three-fold.\r\rFirst, the price of housing in Canada is already inflated as a result of speculation caused by ever increasing housing prices as a result of a decade of record low interest rates. Think about it, houses are now twice as expensive as they were a decade ago, yet people don't earn twice as much money, how is this possible? A rise in the interest rate will cause double damage - it will increase the mortgage rate, and second it will pop the bubble.\r\rSecond, on top if the natural and bubble price decline, the price of housing will decline further because of the low price of oil. People are being laid off, and the average earnings will decline.\r\rThird, there is a huge amount of development going on that is increasing the supply of housing.\r\rSo essentially you have an increase in supply, a decrease in demand, and an external increase in price.\r\rGiven that the BoC is legally mandated to maintain a 2% inflation rate, and the Canadian dollar dipping into the $0.60 will certainly cause inflation beyond that rate, I can't see any other alternative.\r", "So the home looks great and price is my terrible I'll pull some comps when I get to my office\n\nAre you getting showings?\n\nIf not you need to change something.

Yes they are, but nothing compared to what we see with the Calgary market.\n\nCorrection has started and will continue.  But there are a group of people who have money ready to buy and are waiting for this correction.  If we see a 2-3% correction, some of the inventory will be snapped up.  And if it gets to 5-6% territory, it will be a buying opportunity for most people.\n\nEdmonton's housing market is not in a position to crash.  Come 2018 and if oil price is still $30/barrel, then I'll revisit this statement.\n\n\nIf anything, this is a good time for the city to stop developing the outer ring road regions and focus on catching up on infrastructure.  ", "So if I guy was sitting around with a healthy down payment, waiting for a deal on a Mill Creek-area infill, should I jump in this spring, or wait to see if the market softens even more over the next year?", "As I've been saying for a year now price declines are coming to Edmonton.\n\nWhat I find interesting is the fact the cmhc reports monthly declines in 5 of the last 6 months while the Edmonton real estate board reports do not allign with that.\n\n", "I've said it before but the builders are the ones taking the beating and even then they're going to be turning a huge profit clearing out their inventory.\n\n > \u201cWhen we look at overbuilding, we look at the number of units that are complete and unoccupied, as well as the vacancy rate. And last year in Edmonton, we had quite a high level of multi-family construction, so we could start to see those inventory levels trend up, which may lead to an overbuilding concern in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nI've seen more than a few people go to show homes these days and get 10k-40k down from the sticker price they were offering just last year. Otherwise homes in good neighborhoods are holding firm and the fear people are trying to put out there is ridiculous for the Edmonton market.  I think what's happening in Calgary is far worse, far more $600k+ homes that are going into foreclosure from the corporations just axing jobs like crazy.", "Depends where and what don't worry too much there are lots of variables.

It's folly to think 'buyers on the sideline' will stop a price decline as statistically there is not that many such buyers compared to people who already own homes.\n\nYou are right though people who have large cash reserves will have great buying opportunities in the coming years", "I would recommend waiting a year.  Right now people are still likely deluding themselves that even if the market is softening, THEIR house is still worth over-inflated amount X, dammit, and I won't accept a penny less!  Especially for flippers.  Fast forward 6-12 months and people will be desperate to sell because they can't *afford* to sit on them any longer - too-high mortgage payments for their lack of job or position as flippers and other such considerations, combined with them all starting to finally sell at once after holding off for months, will most likely cause a fairly hefty price drop.  Even after that, the comps from those sales will drag down home values for everything else in an area with a lot of homes being sold and even buyers who can afford to sit it out still won't be able to command the higher values, making for a long tail of another 12-18 months of low prices.  Then there will likely be a bump then as people snap up cheap houses as investment properties to rent.\n\nIf anyone's looking for a business idea that will likely go gangbusters in the next couple years, get in on the ground floor for small scale rental property management.  It's such a booming business here in Phoenix that it's de jure now for realty companies to show and service rental homes, not just sale homes.\n\nMy basis for comment:  I lived through the US housing crash in Phoenix\n\n", "I bought a house in Hazeldean back in September taking posession at the end of November.  From my experience house hunting in the Mill Creek area anything good and reasonably priced was still getting snapped up soon after listing.  Some of the houses I looked at that were not great and were overpriced are still up for sale today.\n\nI was the backup offer on the house I ended up buying and was lucky in the sense that the initial offer walked away because their home inspector found some false foundation and roof issues.  Interestingly their inspector missed the fact that the house didn't have a 100 amp service and the \"newly updated furnace\" was in fact 30 years old but I negotiated some money off the price for that.\n\nInstead of spending $700K to $800K on an infill I would look for a nice older house in the $400K - $500K range.  Even if you go nuts and do $100K in renos you would still be ahead.  Get a good home inspector though.", "Mill creek infill you may be able to snap up a lot and build or infill yourself cheaper but fact is priced right these properties sell. From my experience there is a fair amount of mark up and when that is cut into these homes do not last long. Also they will retain their value long term. So unless you see a ton sitting on market for long time it is a matter of finding a house that hits your criteria more so then waiting for price drop. \n\nYou may need to wait two to three years to realize the price drop in those infill. Since the lot has to drop first then the builder needs to build and if in the mean time the market has stabilized you may not see that price you so now. \n\nI am in the same boat but on the west side. :) my wife tells me she wants a new realtor:)", "Steady Eddy basically the builders have to do something they are business but I would think they slow it down but reality is unless people are selling they will not realize an actual loss until they try to sell their home.", "[deleted]", "South of Ellerslie (at least in the SW) is a GREAT location. 5 minutes to LRT and LRT that goes right downtown in ~20 minutes.

", "It is not the simplest thing to get into although it is a good business. The fact you need to be licensed just like a realtor and it is a further money grab imo. They are even forcing condo managers to license. \n\nThat is why people do not realize in the more desirable neighborhood there will be enough offers that the price correction is faster or self correcting. The problem is in new developments where builders discount new builds and how that will affect the price of the resale homes. It is much more competitive and there is more inventory so these are the areas that will see the most correction. That being said some mature areas the lot prices are high and if they go down the whole area becomes more affordable. Fact is we were lot obcenely high to start so the correction will not be as hard. But the market will take a hit for sure. ", "You are right, market topping is a slow process.\n\nOnce sentiment fully changes and people realize a full blown correction is imminent it happens fast though.\n\nI also lived through Americas bubble years in the 2000s and a lot of what I see happening here mirrors the states back then in terms of peoples view of housing always being a good investment no matter the price and willingness to take on massive debt ", "Sorry to hear nature of the east with anything. This is coming from the guy who bought Apple shares at 112 :( ", "I bought in July, and while I wish I waited, as many houses we looked at, especially new built, have gone down drastically in price, it was best to move on, the townhomes I occupied were draining me mentally and I was miserable, therefore the family too was feeling it. It was better moving on than waiting it out", "If you intend on staying in that house for the long-term, you didn't overpay as you will still get a healthy return in 10, 15, 20 years.", "Definitely biased.  The closest LRT would be Century Park, which isn't 5 minutes away from anywhere unless you're just a few blocks away from 23 ave and 111 st - definitely not a description of anyplace south of Ellerslie.  Even so, there isn't anywhere to park on weekdays - the lot is always full unless you get there at like 6AM.  Plus 111st isn't large enough to handle rush hour traffic, and Calgary Trail is always a rush hour nightmare even starting as far south as Ellerslie.\n\nIt's also super far from anything except mostly commercial chain shopping and dining - the sort of thing that appeals to volvo driving soccer moms and recluses.  Want to take in anything other than that, and you have to drive for at least 20-30 minutes to get to something like the Italian Centre or up to the Whyte Ave area for restaurants, bakeries, cafe culture and the like.  ", "So much inventory in new areas, checkout Hamptons or Summerside. Some sweet discounts/reductions are already being seen with undoubtedly more to come. ", "One cannot overpay for peace of mind and well being, IMO.  That's why I rent a house instead of a cheaper apt even tho I'm a single guy - I *hate* the noise and fuss of living with hundreds of other people just on the other side of my dwelling's walls.", "You're right about parking at Century Park being a huge problem, anyway. That's something the city biffed on BIG time. North side gets lots of park and ride and we get ONE station that allows it and it's full before 7.\n\n\"Volvo soccer moms and recluses?\" That's where you should probably stop stereotyping.

They can be wider and cheaper to heat due to the party wall.\n\nYou are getting the duplex at the price you are because of those factors you are worried about.

If you want to spend the same amount of money you will have to give up things like location and/or level of finishing.\n\nTo answer your question then all those worries you have around a duplex are legitimate but the downsides out of resale and appreciation tend to be minimal compared to a home.

Also a significant drop compared to year to date.

Are people moving around the city, out of the city, out of the country, upgrading, downgrading, etc?\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there are a variety of \"distressed\" types of sales. One can be the classic not being able to make payments anymore. But another can be that they have moved to a new job far away and will wait for a while for prices to rebound. As time goes by they get sick of waiting and just dump the house. \n\nThe same can go for rentals. People might have their old house as a rental. If they can't rent it then they dump it.

This is at the expense of the resale home seller. Once they process their inventory of spec homes you may see a more cautious approach going forward and a halting to the decreases. \n\nIf the choice is building and losing money and not building at all they will simply stop building once they have met their requirements for the development. \n\nThere are deals to be had in these areas but also you are giving up location in the process.

I read twenty two percent of edmintons gdp comes from government jobs. These jobs may be taking a hit and their buying spending power will as well. It will not be enough to see a twenty percent correction. \n\nIf we experience a emigration in the province over a sustained period then I would be warning people that a correction could be coming. But what we are seeing right now is that as a whole there is still confidence and demand it is just smaller then las year which was a great year if I remember correctly. the rapid growth we have experienced in property value is definitely at an end. \n\nIf oil stays where it is today I would expect flat and small decrease in price in Edmonton. Now if interest rates rise and oil is still low we could see a more significant drop. If this drop occurs it will put a complete stop to new construction.

Also I would say there a great deal of inventory that is over priced.\n\nHonestly edmonton has a little bit more diverse economy then calgary. With health care, government and post secondary education areas will keep us going in the near future.\n\nI agree they are a little rosy but our inventory numbers are returning to 2011-2012 numbers.

Even though people moved here for jobs they're settled in for the long run.", "January and February 2014 were pretty exceptional compared to the year prior and as we can see this year with higher inventory, unlikely to repeat. There was a big rush towards selling those mid price homes when so many builders are trying to push into higher end homes in order to increase their profit margin.", "So here are some stats for people to look over. It is kind of amazing the economy of real estate to the city. \n\nThe Edmonton Metro Area had almost 8 billion in transactions this year.\n\nWill we see a return to 2013 numbers or will it be more pronounced.\n\nAnd will the change be a result of a decrease in price or one of demand. \n\nDiscuss", "I'll see if I can get them did not realize it was posted my bad. \n\nEdit\nhttp://www.ereb.com/pdf/MonthlyStats.pdf\n\nJanuary numbers ", "The older generation is scared because of the busts they have witnessed. \n\nThe main difference between then and now.

But as a buyer who is not in any hurry I would say wait to see what is left over when the snow melts.", "So the sales as a whole are down across the board. \nThe listings are up significantly but the thing we have not seen is the effect of the new interest rates. The bank of Canada's announcement has not had enough effect to change January numbers. But from what I have seen is that it is more of the same and it is not the big ticket homes selling it is the smaller ones. \n\nThe same goes for sales. The other thing to bear in mind is that the numbers even the days on market are skewed since a property that get delisted shows up as a listing and its Dom is reset. \n\nAlso note that last year could and should be a peak for real estate in Edmonton for a little while but the values of homes are still higher then last year. If we see a return to last years values we may see an increase of sales. \n\nFebruary will be a continuation but we should see the interest rate have an affect. What I think we are seeing is an early jump on the spring rush but it is not accompanied by the traditional rush of buyers. \n\nThey should return in the spring like the geese but the question will be how many.

{"title": "What do you think will happen with the real estate market in the Edmonton area over the next 12-24 months?", "comments": ["Edmonton has a lot of available homes in all strata on the market, and they're building up scores of subdivisions every building season.\n\nEdmonton is in a rather unique position. Our wages and salaries are notably above the national average, and some of our cost of living factors are somewhat lower than the average.  Y'all might find this hard to believe, but AFA real estate is concerned, we're in a relative affordability bubble.  How long it's going to last is anyone's guess.\n\nYes, inflation is up, interest rates are tempering those other factors.  It's still looking positive at least for the next 12 months.  Hard to say after that.", "It's hard to time the market. Buy when you are ready.", "My two cents would be avoid condos. I've owned one, lived in several. My wife lost her shirt on hers, my brother is down 70k since he bought and has had trouble selling in the last few years. I made money on mine but it wasn't in Edmonton amd I got out at the right time. \n\nCondo boards can be a nightmare. Definitely do a lot of research into the board, reserve funds and how the maintenance and financials look. Check if the unit has had any easements leveled on it. \n\nTry not to buy one in an area with loads of other condo buildings. If you can get into a new one they might have incentives like no condo fees for a year. Avoid places with pools/hottubs/elevators, these amenities mean way higher condo fees, just buy a rec center pass way cheaper.\n\nThis is just my experience and opinion, I'd never buy one again. Rent one and save up more money for a down payment.", "I am not trying to sound self serving but here is my take. \n\nFirst ask yourself a couple of questions. \n\n1: Do you think people will continue to move to Alberta over the next 2 years. \n\n2.Do you want to have others influence your ability to use your property\n\n3. Are you handy?\n\n\nIf people keep moving to Alberta that will help buoy prices or keep them steady. \n\nIf you want more control of your property consider detached or get involved with condo board. Perhaps consider non condo row houses. \n\nIf you are not handy the detached homes in that budget will be either in a rougher area or require some work. \n\n\nFeel free to ask follow up questions.\n\nThere may be some drops to be had but nothing serious.", "There will be a boom eventually but I don't see it in the next two years. Within 10 hopefully.", "[deleted]", "as with many things, buy when you are ready, don't try to time the market. Make sure you can afford the mortgage with breathing room in case payments go up on renewal. And once you buy, stop looking at house prices.\n\nI'm saving to buy this coming year myself, just waiting till I have at least 12k saved up", "We will likely see more record in-migration into the country, province and Edmonton. There will likely be less new home starts in 2023 (I believe I heard the number to be around 6000-7000) instead of the typical 13,000 or so for last year. I work for a builder and we are seeing lot prices up between 15-20% from 2022 to 2023 so we are buying less. Rates are expected to continue to rise and affordability will get worse. I am certain rents will continue to rise and at a faster rate then before. Situation currently sucks for everyone. Sure would be nice to have a crystal ball right about now", "Judging from the last 15 years\u2026 nothing but +/- 10%", "What type of mortgage rate can you get right now? Or are you paying cash?\n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t get into any townhouse that\u2019s in a condo strata here. That market is super saturated.

Unfortunately rates are ridiculous, so hopefully you have a massive down payment", "I\u2019m from Edmonton but lived in Toronto and the GTA over the last decade. Basically been a fanatic talking up all these points every time I come across someone lamenting the costs of housing here.\n\nCall it cultural differences or whatever but people here would rather their existence be a lifetime of struggle than move out west. Never own a home, never raise a family, never be able to retire on their own terms. I think Edmonton\u2019s always going to have this incredible income to house price arbitrage opportunity forever at this point. \n\nI\u2019m lucky/golden handcuffed enough to have a good job but if circumstances changed moving back to Edmonton, making a cash offer on a house and semi-retiring/stay at home dadding would absolutely be in the cards.", "Not only that but the adage \"Time in the market is better than timing the market\" applies to housing too. Do you plan on living in the house for 15-25 years? Then yes, the price will probably go up no matter what. You need a place to live in the meantime anyway.", "Agreed, in addition to what you said, with condos and townhouses you don\u2019t really get the land, you are essentially just buying the unit, which is the part that depreciates. Almost always, unless really luxurious upfront, the building or complex ages poorly. There are also always newer shinier units to compete with that drive prices down. \n\nTownhomes can be a bit of an exception if they are street facing in a good area and/or not under a condo board, but these newer complexes of row homes are essentially condos with private parking under them. They can be even harder to sell than condos, because people buy them specifically to have something new on the cheap. \n\nLook at pretty much any complex of townhomes in the inner suburbs of the city - they have all gone downhill. The same thing will happen to all of these cheap modern townhomes in short order.", "We've owned a condo in Edmonton since 2006, and lived in the unit since 2017. I'm on the condo board. Ours is well run with a healthy reserve fund. Location is important. We live in a desirable neighbourhood and so our condo is worth more than comparables. I would also say don't buy on the ground level floor.  Look for underground heated parking. That being said, our condo's value has plateaued over the last 5 years.", "I know the Condo market isn't great in Edmonton. But I see these 1-2 bed units for like sub 200k in the SW area of the city which as far as I know is fairly desirable and I just think \"how much lower can these things really go?\" I'm just of the opinion that affordable housing will always have a market I guess, whether that's through buying or renting.", "I know this is a relatively old reddit post, but just came across yours.\n\nThe big difference between Edmonton, and the other big 5 (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa and Calgary) is the relatively low rate of foreign investment in the housing market.  We're not a gateway city... yet.\n\nWere that to change, most real estate products would go up in price precipitously.  And it might, because the condo markets in the aforementioned cities have become overheated as a result, and these foreign investors are looking for new, viable markets.  We're likely next.   Then flatline condo prices will be a distant, fond memory.\n\nPeople are going to continue coming to Edmonton for the foreseeable future, both new Canadians and Permanent residents, but intra-migrants from other provinces and regions.\n\nFinally, I think breaking even, or losing a few g on a condo or townhouse or duplex, or even a detached home isn't the worst thing to happen.  Still better than paying rent and seeing the entirety of that money gone into someone else's pocket.  You still have a home.  You're not cashing in your eyeballs for municipal taxes each year, and with most folks amortizing their homes in the 20-30 year range, whatever losses may incur when you sell, are you really going to see it if you only put in 5 or 10 years?", "I agree wholeheartedly with this comment. Townhomes and condos are just a trap.", "1. Potentially. Although I think they're far more likely to pick Calgary as a destination rather than Edmonton however.

Single, no kids, oil field worker. I have a ton of flexibility in my life right now.\n\n3. Not particularly.

I\u2019m moving up for school this summer.", "This is my guess as well, the general demand will keep rising but interest rates limit the actual amount people can pay (to an extent). \n\nI've talked to a bunch of folks who have either adjusted their target price down, paused to raise a bigger deposit, or decided not to buy at all.", "This is incorrect but would apply to a Notley premiership. Please don\u2019t get it backwards.", "I am in Vancouver right now and they ask me why am I not moving there. \n\nThe reason you give are pretty much why. I simply cannot afford that lifestyle. \n\nVancouver is beautiful and will\nAlways be in demand but Edmonton is not the shit hole people make it out to be.", "Well it's -25, hasn't gone above zero at all in December, and the roads are sheer ice even though there hasn't been any freezing rain in months, so just keep that in mind before you move back.

But yes I plan on living in AB for the foreseeable future.", "Well my brother has a sub $200k two bedroom in the sw he'd love to sell... Lol all jokes aside my first place was a condo, so was my wife's. I totally understand the appeal, and condos work for a lot of people honestly. The house I'm in now I had to re do the roof within 5 years of buying it, not something you have to do in a condo for instance. Just understand it's not all sunshine and farts is all. And good luck to you!", "> \"how much lower can these things really go?\"\n\nI ask myself that every year. Then my assessment comes out; down another $6k this year!\n\nBought a 1bedroom unit for $142k in 2016, put a ton of sweat equity into it (+ renovation $$), and its assessed value has dropped about $20k since I purchase. I *might* be able to sell for $125k. \n\n:(", "I think you have some fair points, the future could be really good for present owners. It is a volitile market though. Condo fees range quite a bit and I know many owners who've had easements leveled for work not covered under the maintenance budget. Say you pay $2400 to own the place for 10 years and the rental market dictates a max of $1400 for that area. For renting add $300 for power and internet. So the renter can save $700 a month for a down payment vs owning. Over 10 years that's $84k. The owner has been hit with $7k in easements, put $7500 in the interior to update it in order to be cometetive to sell. With a depressed market after 10 years if they were to sell they would get about $24k after realtor and associated fees. Both 10 year scenarios, $60k difference. All those numbers for the owner btw are actual real world numbers for an owner in a condo right now, I helped paint the walls and re do the floor. \n\nBut it is completely a gamble, could have easily worked the other way, and 10 years from now they could possibly be sitting on much better equity. Hard to say.", "I would the suggest attached row house or duplex as best of all worlds. \n\nCalgary is simply more expensive and that will always eliminate it. \n\nGiven your answers I feel your impression is Edmonton will be pretty flat for prices. On that front I agree with you. \n\nI would not feel a rush to buy right now unless there is a need also do not think there will be a dramatic downturn.", "It is getting tighter unless you are in Leduc and want to be by cactus club.", "Ironic. \n\nLook at what they did before notley.\n\nFailure to get our economy not so reliant on one resource. *40 years to plan this and do it. \n\nHeavy cut backs from certain premiers that people think are great to keep doing (RK).\n\nLet's not forget the sky palace debacle. \n\nNotley gets in and to bring things up to a respectable level has to spend a butt ton money. \nSimilar to someone who buys a crap crap house for renovation. \nI do agree she spent top quickly but eventually needed to anyway. \n\nSo now.\nUcP comes back in...... you let them into the sand box again and they are that weird kid who pees in the corner with Kenny. \n- stops a lot of initiatives to break away from oil eventually.\n- heathcare is a bigger mess thanks to him and shandro..\n- no long term planning for the future. \n\nFast forward to Smith\n \nZero plan what so ever, her entire election platform is to pick a fight with Ottawa and a single person based only on ideologies and nothing else. \nAs a way to deflect the blame away from the UCP and her for there incredibly poor track record. \n\nSo if alberta is hurting its the people who keep voting  PC year after year. \nThis is what happens when you don't hold a government accountable for actions with voting. \n\nSo... keep ruining alberta and making it stay decades behind the rest of the world in progress.", "Just remember that you let yourself feel that way and isn't actually a true statement for most.", "\\>>Say you pay $2400 to own the place for 10 years and the rental market dictates a max of $1400 for that area. <<\n\nThat's assuming people generally get a 10 year mortgage, which many don't.  Still, all things considered, regardless of utilities, muncipal tax (if applicable, some condo strata include it in their monthly fees) and any easements that may come up in the interim of owning the property, it's still equity.  Even if the market continues to flatline or be depressed, it's still more equity than renting.\n\nAll that said, the Canadian market is going through a minor correction right now with these high interest rates, and I wouldn't be too worried about housing starts being essentially halved compared to recent years.  There's a lot of inventory right now on the market, and people are still moving to metro Edmonton.  It's eventually going to pick up.", "Why?

Do not get me started on getting bang for your buck buyers in Edmonton hate getting a good value. /s ", "I know crazy right!", "Let\u2019s first clarify a few terms:\n\nINfill is the process of taking one lot and adding more dwellings as far as city is concerned. So duplex, townhouse and condo projects are all infill. \n\nLand at its highest best use if not the best way to see capital appreciation it is converting it into that highest and best use. I think that is the point you are trying to get across. \n\nSo every lot that is converted or Infilled increases the value of. The remainder who are not. As lots become more scarce their value increases and pushes the value of the others up as well. The first movers get the advantage here. \n\nAs to your first question how long has it been going on redevelopment of old areas since the 90s but the lot splitting is a new phenomena that resulted from the city\u2019s implementation of the mature Neighbourhood overlay. While certain areas could have duplexes previously now they can be subdivided. While the home that results may be less property it\u2019s value tends to exceed a larger duplex simply due to the ability to control the land and the negative aspects of a duplex real or perceived. \n\nNow on to those desirable areas. What makes them desireavle over other areas. Tends to be three things in my view. \n\nClose to core is one \n\nLarge lots is another\n\nCLose to the river is a third \n\nClose to other amenities or attractions \n\nIf you look at these three aspects in Edmonton you could put most of the desirable areas in to one or all of these categories. \n\nHowever there are some that do have these traits but are not desireable. ( these are the future areas of transition). \n\nNow why do people not want the bungalow with large lot. \n\nThe risk, the perceived head aches and the desire for something modern. \n\nWhile you may add value to the home you are moving it further from the highest and best use and sinking value into a depreciating asset. Lot value homes could be over valued funnily enough because the home on top is actually a cost instead of benefit to buyer. If the home is moderately live able the buyer may rent until they are ready to develop. \n\nFun thing is the issuable square footage is pretty close between infill and bungalow due to the basement space but it is seldom considered. \n\nThe open school district and fact that these schools have room mean petiole may be over paying. Is Lynn wood that much worse than Laurier. Is a skinny in crest wood really worth the 200-400k premium compared to jasper park or place. \n\nMyself I will likely be going the old bungalow renovation route because I cannot bring myself to pay for that highest and best use of a property.

The total cost of providing public transit services has grown by 211% between 2000 and 2018, from $105 million to $327 million. In the same period, total revenue increased by 166% from $51 million to $136 million. The total operating subsidy provided by the tax levy increased by 254% from $54 million in 2000 to $191 million in 2018. This has resulted in the tax levy subsidizing 58% (2018) of its operations compared to 51% (2000)\n\n> User fares aren't close to enough and those increases on their own have never been enough. \n\nNo one is arguing that. Like you said we all know this. But to claim that transit funding hasn't increased in the last 20 years is completely false. Over the last 22 years it's increased 211%. Perhaps instead of begging for more money they could do more with the money given. But alas no. They know they can't keep raising transit fairs as they are already way too high, so their brilliant solution is going to be to tax other forms of transportation. \n\nAs an example 4 adults going from Southgate to Roggers Place for a hockey game would cost $14 one way.

Basically cities will have the power to decide where housing gets built, but they'll be stripped of the power to actually effectively veto affordable housing.\n\nThis is the solution, not railing against the Feds, who have the least number of levers", ">How so?\n\nCash only means you're reducing accessibility, which is your point, but the way you reduce accessibility is equally important. Cash up front means that only those who already have large amount capital have access to that investment vehicle. \n\n>Landlords would just pass on the costs to the renters\n\nMarket rent rates track, but lag behind, cost of ownership. This soft cap combined with the diminishing returns on rental income would effectively prevent this. Combine any kind of rent control and this is not a concern. I'm on mobile so I'm not going to go into further detail. \n\n>Cash only investment properties would be even more effective...\n\nDisagree for the same reason explained under \"how so?\"\n\n>Agreed that we need more supply. But that is a very long term solution. It's much quicker to address the demand side of the equation.\n\nChanges in the housing market: fast, significant, doesn't destroy the economy. Pick any 2. \n\nOne aspect of what I suggested that I didn't explain, was the rollout. What I was suggesting cannot happen across the board all at once. There are a number of ways to stage the rollout. A rollout slows things down, but again - pick any 2."]}
